# Car Rental Website Upgrade Instructions

Follow these steps to implement all the improvements to your car rental website:

## 1. Update Dependencies

Run the dependency update script:

```bash
node update-dependencies.js
```

Then install the new dependencies:

```bash
# Backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## 2. Verify Component Structure

Ensure the following components have been added:
- PremiumFleet component (added below Hero section)
- A11yProvider component
- SkipLink component
- Accessibility styles

## 3. Test the Application

Start both frontend and backend:

```bash
# Start backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Start frontend
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

## 4. Verify New Features

- Check that the "Our Premium Fleet" section appears below the Hero section
- Test accessibility features (high contrast mode, reduced motion)
- Verify that the skip link works for keyboard navigation
- Test the responsive design on different devices

## 5. Production Deployment

Before deploying to production:
- Review the PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md file
- Run the build process for both frontend and admin
- Deploy using the provided Docker configuration or CI/CD pipeline

## Additional Notes

- The accessibility features require the A11yProvider to be properly initialized
- The OptimizedImage component can be used to replace standard img tags for better performance
- The service worker provides offline capabilities and should be registered in your main.tsx file
